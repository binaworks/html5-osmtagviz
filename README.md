# OpenStreetMap Tag Explorer

Web app for visualizing [OpenStreetMap tags](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags).
This is unfinished work in progress.

Started with [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com).
Data visualization implementation help came mainly from this [blog](http://jeromegagnonvoyer.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/creating-a-data-visualization-tool-using-d3-js-crossfilter-and-leaflet-js/) by Jérôme Gagnon-Voyer.
OpenStreetMap data is queried using the [Overpass API](http://overpass-api.de/). Learning how to use the API was greatly facilitated by experimenting with [overpass turbo](http://overpass-turbo.eu/).
